SOAR is a Solana program repository that provides a seamless solution for creating leaderboards and achievements on the Solana blockchain. With support for invocation from a TypeScript client and the upcoming integration with the Solana.Unity-SDK, SOAR aims to simplify the process of managing and tracking achievements in decentralized applications.

## ⚙ Features
Leaderboard Creation: Easily create leaderboards to track and display user rankings based on specific criteria or metrics.
Achievement Management: Define and manage achievements that can be unlocked by users based on their on-chain activities.
Typescript Client Support: Invoke SOAR functionalities using a TypeScript client, allowing for seamless integration with your Solana application.
CPI Invocation: Interact with SOAR through CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) calls, enabling secure and efficient communication between programs.
Solana.Unity-SDK Integration (Coming Soon): Integration with the Solana.Unity-SDK is currently underway, providing an additional layer of functionality for Unity-based applications.
